Within CRC1502 DETECT, we aim at improving our understanding of regional climate change beyond greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. We focus on disentangling the role that changes in land use and water management as drivers of climate change can play via modifying the water cycle. We believe that complementing the picture of local climate change drivers—besides CO 2 and other GHGs—by accounting for these important channels is mandatory today.

In our subproject, A05, we aim at an improved representation of how farmers adapt to climate change, altering weather (extremes), production risk and efficiency, and ultimately expectations on farming returns. Yet to date, farms seem reluctant to adapt their farming structure. Based on the real options approach, we hypothesize that this reluctance can be explained by farms’ investment behavior under risk and various sources of inefficiency. We test this hypothesis using observational data. To understand underlying cognitive decision processes under extreme hydrometeorological events, we test the impact of such perceived instances on farm adaptation decisions using an experimental approach.
